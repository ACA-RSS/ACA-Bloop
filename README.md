##  Instructions:
You start the game in the bottom left corner of the screen and use the WASD keys to navigate the map. To use your weapon, a stick, press the space bar. Walk up to stars at hit them to add them to your collected stars. Once you have collected all three stars for the level, return to your starting point to finish. 

## Work Completed:
* Title screen runs with working links to an About page, a Help page, and an option to select a difficulty and start a new game or load an old one.
* The game screen opens and all creatures and walls are placed. There is a bar displaying the health, number of stars found, and points of the player, and another Menu button that pauses the game and has Save, About, and Help buttons.
* Animals attack and can be defeated, and stars can be collected

## Known Issues:
